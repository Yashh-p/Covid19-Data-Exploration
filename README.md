# Covid19-Data-Exploration
Covid Data Exploration and Analysis with SQL (SQL SERVER)
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted global health, economies, and societies. Analyzing COVID-19 datasets provides invaluable insights into the spread and impact of the virus, as well as the effectiveness of measures taken to combat it. The COVID-19 dataset contains extensive information on confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, testing rates, vaccination progress, and more across various regions and countries.

Exploration and Analysis Approach:
While exploring COVID-19 data with SQL, I focused on understanding key trends, patterns, and correlations within the dataset. This involved analyzing factors such as infection rates over time, geographical distribution of cases, demographic factors influencing transmission, and the impact of public health interventions. By leveraging SQL queries, I aimed to uncover actionable insights that can inform decision-making, policy development, and public health strategies in response to the pandemic.

Key Tasks Performed:

* Checked all the details of the table such as column names, data types, and constraints.
* Identified and removed duplicate values in all columns.
* Streamlined the dataset by removing unwanted columns.
* Segmented Covid data into two different tables, namely CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations, and performed data exploration using joins.

Insights Explored:

* Total Cases Vs Total Deaths: This comparison shows the likelihood of dying if you contract Covid in your country.
* Total Cases Vs Population: This analysis indicates the percentage of the population that has contracted Covid.
* Countries with the Highest Infection Rate compared to Population: Identifies countries with the highest infection rates.
* Highest Death Count per Population: Reveals the highest death count per population.
* Highest Death Count per Population by Continent: Highlights the highest death count per population by continent.
* Max Death Count Global Numbers: Presents the maximum death count globally.
* Total Population Vs Vaccination: Explores the relationship between total population and vaccination progress.
